# three.js-demos

Just some three.js demos.

Demos will be separated into three categories: basic, intermediate and advanced.

I will add more when I'm still interested in three.js. :)

Note: I do not care about old browser such as IE, so I will use ES6+ for ease of coding when I think it is appropriate.

# Run

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
2. Install http-server globally via npm.

```
npm install -g http-server
```

3. Run http-server in the folder of a demo:

```
cd XXXX/three.js-demos/basic/01_custom_shader
http-server ./
```

4. Open the demo in a web browser such as Chrome:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
